      <description>This codelab shows you how to build a CPU optimized custom TensorFlow Serving Docker image with your own TensorFlow model. With this, you will have a better performant TensorFlow deployment depending on the currently available CPU platform.&#xA;What you&amp;rsquo;ll learn How to build CPU optimized TensorFlow Core Docker image How to build custom TF Serving Docker image How to modify the TF Serving Docker image to have a custom TensorFlow model How to push the custom TF Serving Docker image to GCR(Google Cloud Registry) What you&amp;rsquo;ll need Machine to deploye TF Serving TF Serving repository provides a easy-to-use tool to build both custom TensorFlow Core and TF Serving Docker images out of the box, and the tool leverages Docker technology under the hood.</description>

      <description>TensorFlow Extended(TFX) gives you the power of building a end to end machine learning pipeline. However it is somewhat difficult to grasp the ideas coupled with the actual codebase, and it is non trivial to write an entire machinie learning project from scratch. aaasdfc bsdfs&#xA;The main advantage of using TFX CLI is that you can get a fully working end to end example out of the box. Also, many customizable points are already included such as how to leverage BigQuery, Vertex AI Training/Serving, Dataflow GCP infrastructure.</description>
